# A2 Genetic Algorithms

# Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Members:

Any peers and/or TAs/Tutors you collaborated with:my peer Alanna Town and TA Elaine were extremely helpful throughout 

Would you like to give "kudos" to anyone who was particularly supportive or helpful? Elaine(TA) and Emily(peer) were great at helping me visualize the psuedo code when I found the instructions confusing.

Brief summary of what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?
I noticed that the winners produced by my genetic algorithm didnt seem to have a pattern based on length. Even with a multitude of rounds, some of the winners had only three chromosomes while some others had six!

Reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

I felt like after psuedo coding the individual class, I had an easier time coding it afterwards and thus coding the GA_Simulation. The hardest part of the assignment for me was rembering the function of constructors and how to utilize them for the needs of this particular assignment. I feel like I learned more about my java capabilities whilst doing this. On top of implementing an effective constructor I also rembered how initilization with array lists worked which doesn't seem like a big feat but was something I had to google lots of times.
